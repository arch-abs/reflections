Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?


A: Incase our local branch is lost we can use remote as a backup.
Also having commits uploaded to remote makes it easier collaborating from distance as we reviewing of code.


Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manual pulling gives us more control.
